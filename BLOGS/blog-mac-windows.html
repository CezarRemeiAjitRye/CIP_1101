        <h2>Two Systems</h2>
        <p>
            As a BSIT student, I've had the chance to use both <strong>Mac and Windows.</strong> Honestly, I like both of them because they both have their own strengths and weaknesses. At first, I thought i need to pick the best one but over time I realized it depends on how you work and what you value. and I have experienced both worlds through schoolwork, gaming, coding, and daily use. This blog is my personal take on what I like about about them and which one I prefer.
        </p>

        <h2>Strengths in Both</h2>
        <p>
            One thing I like about <strong>Mac</strong> is how smooth and clean everything feels. It's simple but it has a premium feel to it, and also it is not overhelming. and things just work smoothly without too much set up. I love how stable it is, how it rarely lag or crash when doing tasks for school, brownsing, and even games that is possible to run on mac. For me, mac is perfect especially as a studen when I want to focus more on practical usage in daily life as a student without worrying about system issues. Another thing I like is how optimized everything feels. Even with specs not that high, It's still fast and its a big thing especially for someone who values efficiency.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Windows</strong> feels more flexible and powerful, especially for IT related tasks. I like how vast the customization is. From software choices to system settings. And when I'm programming, installing tools, or using virtual machines I feel like I have more control over the system. In gaming, I have more freedom compare to mac. because it's a platform that most developers use to publish their games, and for that reason I can play whatever games I want that my specs can handle. Hardware upgrades are also better on Windows. Since I use a desktop, I like that I can upgrade parts anytime. Windows gives me freedom to explore , and learn more deeply about how systems work.
        </p>

        <p>
            So answering the question, Mac or Windows? Now I prefer <strong>windows</strong> because it gives me my needs an an IT student. It's more hands on, and has more tools to provide to be able to learn and develop skills I want to build. It has more tools, has a bigger platform especially for games I want to play with my friends. Being said that, I still have a soft spot for Mac, If my focus was just my own productivity and creativity, and alsohas a bigger platform for games and also has the tools I need to get through my course I'd probably choose it over windows. But for coding, an IT student, and for the interests I have now, Windows seem to be the better choice for me.
        </p>

        <h2>Choosing What Fits</h2>
        <p>
            Using both sides have thaught me something, and that is there is really no <strong>"one best" operating system.</strong> What matters more is how well it supports goals and interests. So choose a tool that helps you grow and you're satisfied with not just whatever looks better or what's more popular. As I finish my years as an IT student, I'll stick with windows. Who knows maybe when apple releases a major update that aligns with what I want, maybe... just maybe, I'll switch.
