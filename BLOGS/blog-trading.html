        <h2>Beyond One Path</h2>
        <p>
            Most people expect na as a BSIT student, my only goal is to land a good job in tech. And yeah, that's part of it. Pero the more I think about my future, the more I realize na ayaw kong i-limit yung sarili ko sa isang path lang. I want to build wealth... and salary. I want financial freedom, not just financial stability. That's why aside from pursuing a career in IT, I'm seriously planning to become a <strong>trader</strong>. Hindi siya backup plan or side hobby lang. It's something I genuinely want to be good at. This blog is about how I'm planning to balance both worlds and why I believe kaya kong gawin pareho.
        </p>

        <h2>Stability While Chasing Freedom</h2>
        <p>
            Let me be clear, <strong>trading is what excites me the most right now</strong>. Yung idea na you can grow your money through strategy, analysis, and discipline. I've been watching trading videos, and observing how the market moves. Hindi pa ako nag-start mag actual trade, pero I'm taking my time to learn properly kasi I know na risky siya pag hindi ka prepared. In five years, I see myself as someone who's consistently profitable, someone who understands market psychology, and someone who treats trading like a real business, not gambling. I want to reach a point where my trading income can eventually surpass my IT salary, and maybe even become my primary source of income.
        </p>

        <p>
            But I'm also realistic. Alam ko na trading alone, especially at the start, won't pay the bills. That's where my <strong>IT career comes in</strong>. I'm planning to work in tech, probably in cloud computing or software development, para may stable income while I'm building my trading skills. Yung sweldo ko sa IT, yun yung magiging capital ko for trading and living expenses. It's also a safety net in case mag struggle ako sa trading. Pero hindi ibig sabihin na bare minimum lang yung gagawin ko sa IT. I still want to be good at it, get certifications like AWS or Azure, and build a solid career. It's just that for me, IT is the foundation, pero trading is the dream. Parang yung IT gives me the resources to pursue what I really want, which is financial independence through the markets.
        </p>

        <p>
            To make both work, kailangan ko ng <strong>discipline and time management</strong>. After work, maybe i'd go chilling or gaming for a bit, and spend time studying charts, backtesting strategies, and keeping a trading journal. Weekends, after some time with family and friend i'd go learning, reviewing my trades, and improving my system. I know mahirap balancing both, lalo na pag demanding yung work, pero I've seen people do it. I'm also planning to start with paper trading muna, then slowly transition to real money once confident na ako. I'll start small, maybe 1k or so lang, para hindi malaki yung pressure and risk. Slowly, as I prove to myself na kaya ko, I'll scale up. The goal is to be patient, consistent, and unemotional. Yung mga traders na nag fail, usually dahil sa greed or fear. I want to avoid that by sticking to a plan and treating it like a skill, not a get-rich-quick scheme.
        </p>

        <h2>My Own Future</h2>
        <p>
            It's not the typical route na graduate, mag work lang, then repeat hanggang retirement. I want more than that. I want to build something for myself, and trading is my way of doing that. IT will give me the stability, the income, and the skills to support myself, pero trading is where I'll build real wealth. I know risky siya, I know kailangan ng patience, and I know maraming failed traders. But I also know na yung mga successful traders, they treated it seriously, they learned continuously, and they didn't give up. That's the mindset I'm bringing into this. So five years from now, I hope to look back and see na worth it yung hustle, na yung vision ko became reality, and I'm living the kind of life I actually want, not just the one na expected sakin.
